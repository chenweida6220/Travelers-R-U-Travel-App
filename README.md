# Travelers 'R' U Travel App
### Project Overview
Travelers "R" U was a comprehensive UX design project focused on creating a mobile and web application for a travel agency. The goal was to develop a platform that provides users with curated travel itineraries, transportation logistics, and a seamless booking experience, ultimately making travel planning more efficient and personalized.
### The Problem
Travellers lack access to a streamlined, personalized travel planning experience. They struggle to view their itineraries alongside transportation logistics and find it difficult to customize their trips on existing platforms, leading to inefficiency and frustration.
### Target User
The primary persona, Kevin Chen, is a 28-year-old professional living in Brooklyn, NY. He has a busy lifestyle, loves to travel in his free time, and values efficiency and personalized experiences. His main pain points include the difficulty of personalizing itineraries on existing platforms and dealing with under-performing APIs that slow down the booking process.

# The UX Process & Key Deliverables
### 1. User Research (Discovery)
* **Methods:** Surveys, Competitive Analysis (Feature Inventory, Plus/Delta, Task Analysis).
* **Key Insights:** Users want simplified website formats, more discounts, and a more personalized travel experience.
* **Deliverables:** Research Plan, User Persona (Kevin Chen), Problem Statements.
### 2. Information Architecture
* **Methods:** Card Sorting (with 10 participants), User Flows, Storyboarding.
* **Key Insights:** Users expect all flight-related information to be grouped together, and savings-related features (Discounts, Bundles) should be in a single category.
* **Deliverables:** Card Sort Report, Sitemap, User Flow, Storyboard.
### 3. Sketching & Wireframing (Skeleton)
* **Methods:** Hand-sketched Wireflows, Digital Wireframes (using Figma).
* **Design Rationale:** Focused on visual appeal and simplicity, with a fixed bottom navigation bar to prevent accidental page changes.
* **Deliverables:** Three annotated digital wireframes, a paper wireflow, and a descriptive brief.
### 4. Prototyping & Usability Testing (Validation)
* **Methods:** A clickable prototype built in Figma and usability tests with 5 participants.
* **Key Finding:** The live chat feature was hard to find; users expected it in the navigation menu (the "3 bars" icon) rather than on the Account page.
* **Recommendation:** Relocate the live chat feature to the main navigation menu for better discoverability.
* **Deliverables:** Usability Test Plan & Script, Test Results Report, Presentation Outline.
### 5. Visual Design (Surface)
* **Process:** Applied essential design concepts like repetition and composition to improve consistency.
* **Visual Identity:** 
  * Color Palette: An analogous palette was chosen to communicate consistency and uniformity.
  * Typography: Roboto Mono was selected for instructional text to make it stand out and capture user attention.
* **Deliverables:** Design improvements log, color palette, and typography guide.
